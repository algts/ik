Default value: 0
 
Specifies  how  many  segments  or  "bones"  this  end-effector is allowed  to
manipulate in order to reach its target. The affected  segments  form  what is
known as a "chain".
 
A value of 0 means "as long as possible". This usually  causes all nodes to be
included in the chain  right  down to the root node. The root node is the node
passed to ik.Solver().  A  chain can terminate earlier if another end-effector
is encountered between the root node and this effector.
