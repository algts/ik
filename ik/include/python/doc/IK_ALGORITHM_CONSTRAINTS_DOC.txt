Default value: False
 
Set to True to enable supporting joint constraints. Set to False to ignore all
attached ik.Constraint objects.
 
Each  solver  has implementation variations for solving with and without joint
constraints.  In  general,  additional calculations need to be performed  each
iteration  before  constraints can be applied, imposing a  slight  performance
impact, which is why the default is False.
 
NOTE:  Changing  this  property after creating a Solver has no effect. If
you need to enable/disable joint constraint support for an algorithm, you will
have  to  re-instantiate a Solver for the  changes  to  take  effect.  Solvers
typically check this flag once on the first call to solve() and then overwrite
the  solve()  function  call  with  the  appropriate  implementation variation
(removing the check).
