Default value: 0.0
 
The  maximum  distance  allowed  between  each  end  effector and  its  target
position.
 
Depending on your world scale, the  tolerance  should be set to something that
is approximately a 10th to a 100th the size of the chain being solved. It is a
trade-off  between accuracy and solver speed,  since  the  less  accurate  the
result has to be, the earlier the solver can bail.
 
A  value  of  0.0 disables early bail-out and  solvers  will  iterate  exactly
max_iterations number of times.
