How many times to iterate  the  algorithm.
 
FABRIK converges extremely quickly, you can sometimes  get  away with just 3-5
iterations. MSS takes longer  to  converge, approximately 100-1000 iterations.
ONE_BONE and TWO_BONE solvers ignore both of these values since they calculate
the result directly.
 
If you are more concerned  with  accuracy,  an  optimal  approach is to switch
between two modes of operation depending on whether the target is within reach
or not. If the target  is within reach, then you can set the maximum iteration
count to a very high value (such as 10000) and set the tolerance to a non-zero
value. The solver will likely bail much earlier than 10000 iterations when the
target  is in reach, so it will still be performant.  If  the  target  is  not
within  reach,  then you can set the iteration count to a very low value (such
as 5 for FABRIK) which is enough to calculate  a  pose  that  reaches  for the
target.
 
NOTE: The maximum value is 65535 because  internally  the value is stored as a
16-bit unsigned integer.
